## Here is a fun tool to help visualize how spatial partitioning works. Spatial partitioning is an important programming pattern that can help improve performance for graphic-heavy or memory-intensive rendering. For the tool, SDL Libraries are utilized (you may need to download them into your computer in order to run the tool locally)
